# Vehicle-Sales-Analysis
This is a Power BI visualization project

Sales Performance Analysis is a way to measure your sales progress over a period of time. The analysis allows you and your sales team to identify weaknesses in your sales strategy and make changes so that you can improve the results over the next period. It also provides several significant advantages to businesses and this includes identifying areas of improvement, tracking progress, as well as increasing revenue.

I analyzed this Vehicle sales dataset from [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data?resource=download) and conducted a Sales Performance Analysis to provide insights on: 
* How is the company's overall performance?
* What are the most profitable product lines?
* What are the top-selling product lines in each country/ region?
* Which customers are the most valuable to the company?
* What are the different types of deals and how are the product lines associated with those deals?
* When are sales target met over the years and months?

A few things to note:
* The date listed are from 2003-2005 (with only the first two quarters for 2005).

## Process
#### Steps taken toward the completion of this project include:

## Outcomes
* The 4th quarter experienced the highest total sales of about $3.8m with an average sales of $3,541 ( the average sales for each quarter does not show much difference). One possibility is such that the 4th quarter is a critical time to boost profits and  it is also when many consumers open up their wallets and start spending more.
* The top 5 customers Euro Shopping Channel, Mini Gifts Distributors Ltd, Australian Collectors co, Muscle Machine Inc and La Rochelle Gifts made a total sales of $2.1m and profit of $378k and seems to be key customers.
* Classic cars proved to be a lucrative venture, accumulating an impressive sum of  approximately $4m in revenue and $951k in profit.
* The overview trend of sales versus shipped value shows that most of the orders are shipped on time, resulting to  fulfilled order and as such can increase customer satisfaction, guarantee repeat purchases and improve return on investment(ROI).
